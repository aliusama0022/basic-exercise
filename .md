# Project Name

This repository contains a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for building, testing, linting, and deploying a Node.js application with Docker containerization.

---

## Overview

The project leverages GitHub Actions workflows to automate:

- **Docker image build and push** to GitHub Container Registry (`newPipeline.yml`)
- **Issue event handling** workflows (`issues.yml`)
- **Code linting, testing, building, and deployment** (`deployment1.yml` and `deployment2.yml`)

---

## Workflows Description

### 1. Docker Build & Push (`newPipeline.yml`)

- Triggers on push or pull request events targeting the `main` branch.
- Builds Docker images using `docker/build-push-action`.
- Pushes images to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`).
- Supports caching for faster builds.
- Deploys application on successful image build (placeholder steps for deployment).

### 2. Issue Handling (`issues.yml`)

- Triggers on new issues opened.
- Outputs event details for debugging or further automation.
- (Optional) Can automatically create follow-up issues using community GitHub Action.

### 3. Deployment Pipelines (`deployment1.yml` & `deployment2.yml`)

- Triggered on push events.
- Run linting (`npm run lint`), testing (`npm run test`), and build (`npm run build`) commands.
- Deploy step (currently a placeholder) that can be customized to your deployment environment.
- Pipelines differ slightly to demonstrate various workflow structuring.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js environment with project dependencies defined in `package.json`.
- Docker installed locally for building/testing images.
- GitHub repository with secrets configured (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

### Running Workflows

- Push commits or create pull requests targeting `main` branch to trigger Docker build workflow.
- Open new issues to trigger the issue workflow.
- Push code changes to trigger deployment workflows.

---

## Customization

- Modify deployment steps in workflows to suit your hosting platform (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS, Azure).
- Customize issue workflow to add labels, assign users, or comment on new issues.
- Add more workflows or extend existing ones for additional automation.
